Project overview

Dark Trace AI is a full-stack prototype that ingests chat-style messages (text + emoji + basic metadata), detects messages likely related to illicit drug activity using a hybrid rule + ML approach, explains decisions (SHAP + fired rules), and surfaces high-risk users/groups in a graph view for analyst triage.

Goals:

Provide a reproducible baseline detection pipeline (feature extraction → GBM classifier → SHAP explanations).

Combine rule-based red flags from a curated slang/emoji lexicon with supervised learning to reduce false positives.

Produce actionable UI outputs for human analysts: ranked alerts, per-alert explanation, and a network graph highlighting hubs.

Highlights & features

Pluggable dataset format (CSV). Example sample files included (/data/).

Curated slang & emoji dictionaries (text + emoji CSVs).

Balanced synthetic datasets for prototyping (samples included).

Feature engineering:

Per-entity rolling statistics (counts, sums, unique counterparties).

Message-level lexical features (presence of slang tokens, emoji tokens, price/units).

Graph features (degree, PageRank, components) via networkx and optional neo4j.

Model: XGBoost / LightGBM baseline with SHAP explanations.

API (FastAPI) that returns {probability, risk_score, top_shap, rules} for each message.

Minimal React UI example (alerts table + alert detail + graph view).

Quick demo (run locally)

These steps assume you cloned slang-sentinel-ai into your local machine.

Create Python environment (recommended Python 3.10+)

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt


Data (sample CSVs already in /data/):

data/synthetic_slang_sample.csv

data/synthetic_emoji_sample.csv

Feature extraction + quick train (toy)

# run feature engineering (creates /artifacts/features.parquet)
python scripts/feature_engineering.py --input data/synthetic_slang_sample.csv --out artifacts/slang_features.parquet

# train a baseline model (XGBoost)
python scripts/train_model.py --features artifacts/slang_features.parquet --model-out models/slang_xgb.pkl


Run the model service (FastAPI)

# starts at http://localhost:8000
uvicorn app.api:app --reload --port 8000


Quick test (curl)

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/score" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id":"user_123","platform":"Telegram","timestamp":"2025-08-31 10:00:00","message":"anyone got an 8-ball of snow?"}'


Response:

{
  "probability": 0.92,
  "risk_score": 92,
  "threshold": 0.80,
  "top_features": [
    {"name":"slang_presence", "shap":0.34},

Modeling approach

Baseline recommended pipeline:

Rules / Lexicon flags: boolean flags for presence of known slang terms / emoji tokens (from dictionaries). Use as high-precision seeds.

Tabular features:

lexical: slang_count, emoji_count, presence of price tokens ($, cash, rs, k), weight tokens (oz, ounce, 8-ball, gram).

temporal: message hour-of-day, day-of-week, timestamp recency.

behavioral: messages-per-hour (sender), unique counterparties count, join/leave events (if available).

graph: degree, pagerank, avg neighbor risk.

Model: XGBoost / LightGBM with class weight or scale_pos_weight. Evaluate with PR-AUC, precision@k, F1 at target precision.

Explainability: SHAP to return top contributing features; show fired rules for analyst transparency.

Fusion: final risk score = weighted combination of model_prob and rule_severity_sum. Provide thresholds configurable in UI.

Recommended hyperparameters (starting point):

XGBoost: n_estimators=500, max_depth=6, learning_rate=0.05, scale_pos_weight=neg/pos

LightGBM: num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=500, class_weight='balanced'

Data pipeline & preprocessing

Primary steps (scripts implement these):

Normalize timestamps → UTC.

Tokenize messages (basic whitespace + emoji tokenizer).

Detect slang tokens using regex/word-boundary matching (case-insensitive).

Normalize numeric mentions (prices, weights) into message_contains_price & message_contains_weight.

Compute per-user rolling windows (1h, 6h, 24h) using time-sorted logs; store as features.

Build user-graph: edges = sender → recipient (where available) / co-occurrence in same group; compute degree, pagerank.

Train/test split: chronological split by date (no leakage). Validate by time-split cross-validation.

Training & evaluation (commands)

Feature extraction:

python scripts/feature_engineering.py \
  --input data/synthetic_slang_dataset.csv \
  --out artifacts/slang_features.parquet


Train model:

python scripts/train_model.py \
  --features artifacts/slang_features.parquet \
  --model-out models/slang_xgb.pkl \
  --cv-folds 5 \
  --target-col label


Evaluate (produces PR curve, precision@k, confusion matrix):

python scripts/evaluate.py --model models/slang_xgb.pkl --features artifacts/slang_features.parquet


Outputs:

/models/slang_xgb.pkl — saved model

/artifacts/eval/ — PR/ROC curves and evaluation metrics CSV

/artifacts/shap_explainer.pkl — SHAP explainer (optional to serialize)

Key metrics to report:

PR-AUC (primary)

Precision @ N alerts/day (simulate expected daily volume)

Recall at fixed precision (e.g., recall at 90% precision)

GET /health — service health

Request example:

{
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "platform": "Telegram",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-31 10:00:00",
  "message": "selling 8-ball of snow, dm"
}

Ethics, Privacy & Limitations

Important responsibilities and constraints:

Privacy: Only analyze data you are legally authorized to process. Never upload private/unencrypted personal messages without authorization and appropriate safeguards.

False positives risk: Detection models will produce false positives; always present alerts with explainability and human-in-the-loop triage.

Bias & fairness: Synthetic datasets and scoped slang dictionaries can introduce domain bias. Validate on real, authorized data where possible.

Adversarial behavior: Actors may change slang quickly; maintain lexicon updates and continuous monitoring.

Legal compliance: Follow local law and platform policies when collecting data (platform TOS, privacy regulations, etc.).

Produce a polished requirements.txt and docker-compose.yml next.

Add example curl requests and Postman collection.

Generate the full 10k CSVs (balanced and varied) and place them in /data/ and a small script to refresh slang dictionaries from a YAML file.
